# Learning about Version Control
Author : Raghav Gupta  
Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!  
The thing I like the most about version control is that keeps complete history of my work, so I can track every change & revert without the fear of losing anything.  
What I find most challenging about version control is dealing with merge conflicts & keeping all the branches in sync. Sometimes, it can sometimes be confusing to understand which changes should be kept & how to resolve them correctly.
